                You have the newest version, read our other suggestions for fixing your problem. Open apple music on the main page. With the introduction of apple music, apple tweaked its shuffle algorithm to enable adding songs to an up next queue.
    </p>

    <h3>If you recently added new songs to your apple music account, but they aren&#039;t showing up on your iphone, you probably have to turn on automatic music.</h3>
    <p>This allows you to break the normal shuffle and add a song that you&#039;d like to listen to, next. Find the next song, (with the ring of dots), on the laptop, then find it on the iphone8 and tap it once. Apple also has original shows in the form of carpool karaoke, vital signs and planet of the apps coming, and just landed the exclusive rights to the clive davis documentary. People have been reporting issues where the play later option just doesn&#039;t show up.</p>
