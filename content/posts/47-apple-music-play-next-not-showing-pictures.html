    <p><strong>47+ Apple Music Play Next Not Showing Pictures</strong>. Yes, me too on my iphone x (ios 13.1) it is still showing next but on my iphone 11 pro max after updationg to 13.2 it is. What i have figured out is that the play next and play later options are hidden automatically when the device is connected to another player.</p>

                Tracks that were once available on apple music may have been retracted by the artist or their record company, temporarily or permanently, for all regions or for selected regions. When trying to play a song, apple music shows errors such as items not available, unexpected error code 4010, this media is not supported. This temporarily restores your ability to play those songs, but the next time you backup you will lose them again.

    <h3>Apple music is not playing on iphone 8/8 plus/7/7s/6s/6 plus.</h3>
    <p>Open the settings app and tap your name or image at the top of the menu. After i did that, adam christianson told me, i was able to play any song in apple music without getting the &#039;the song cannot be played because. Afterward, restart your phone, and then head into the google play store to reinstall apple. In most cases, apple music not playing on your device results from a sync issue.</p>
