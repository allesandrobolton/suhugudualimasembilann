    <p><strong>12+ Bluetooth Not Playing Music In Car Images</strong>. My old oneplus one connected with no issue with the same multimedia system in my car, which means it has to be a phone related problem. Hi, i have a problem my phone is connected to bluetooth device but when i play music the sound comes from phone speakers instead coming from i had this problem as well.</p>

                The ideal screen size to assist you in driving. The usb jack is not good either after like 30 seconds the music stops and keeps telling me to check device. While bluetooth is supposed to be universal, devices that employ different versions of the standard can sometimes conflict.

    <p>Either way, have it or not, wouldn&#039;t it be cool to have a bluetooth gadget/widget/box that can connect with the 3.5mm jack that works with your music player (home sound system, car, stereo, tv) like a usual bluetooth device (&gt;&gt;,&gt;,ii,&lt;,&lt;&lt;, and one more. Is no better way to play music! Without knowing how to cut cables, is there a way to play music thru bluetooth in the mmi? It won&#039;t mix audio from multiple sources if that&#039;s what you&#039;re.</p>

        <p>However if i try to play music in the phone (being cast over bluetooth and played via the car&#039;s speakers) , whether it&#039;s locally stored on the phone or and there is no fault in the car&#039;s bluetooth since a nexus 4 (my old phone) is able to stream music to the car with no problem whatsoever, and.</p>
