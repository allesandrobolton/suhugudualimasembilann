                Family sharing in apple music is an extension of the family sharing feature that debuted with ios 8 last year. However, when i want to invite my friend into this sharing plan, it often prompts her to get a subscription of apple music. Has anyone been able to get this to work properly?

    <h3>This video is a tutorial on how to add someone to family sharing enabling them to use apple music this video was intentionally made for those who say you.</h3>
    <p>You have to set up family sharing, and then invite their accounts if you don&#039;t already have. But i recently decided to upgrade my apple music account to a family plan to take advantage of the discount as i encourage family. If you already have family sharing set up and are just looking to add new family members, skip to the next section.
