                Apple music is a streaming service for apple and android devices. I have songs that i always listen to but it just happened those songs are now greyed out and tells me it&#039;s not available to my country. If the song isn&#039;t licensed to the country your vpn connection is routed to, then.

    <h3>Why are some songs not available on apple musicï¼Ÿ</h3>
    <p>Although i&#039;m a longtime apple fanboy, itunes/apple music has become a major irritant. The other apple id for the other country if/when what you need is not available with your existing account. I got in touch with apple music support. Generally speaking, every country has an entire music library of more than 70 no matter which country and region you are in, downloading apple music songs to your device and playing them offline through a local music player.</p>
