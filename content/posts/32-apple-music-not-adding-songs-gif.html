                Before apple music, this was common sense; Meanwhile, if i rate a song on my iphone or ipad, i see that change almost instantly on my mbp. Just keep in mind that if you mark songs you love in apple music, the song must be added to your library in order for it to be added to the smart playlist you create.

    <h3>Either that or buy it directly from the itunes app on your device.</h3>
    <p>Ive been creating playlist as usual but when i got to see the playlist none of the songs i added to the playlist are there? If you want a song on your iphone, you pretty much have to use itunes to get it on there. Itunes installation/download/update errors, including apple mobile device service missing. Either that or buy it directly from the itunes app on your device.</p>
