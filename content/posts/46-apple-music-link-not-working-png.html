                Unfortunately, a few awkward steps in apple music&#039;s and family sharing&#039;s infrastructure have kept this process from working as smoothly as it should. I&#039;m trying to play apple music to my lenovo smart clock, but it isn&#039;t working. That link, was working perfectly in itunes store, but now is not working any more.
    </p>

    <h3>Apple music customers have been left unable to search for new artists, tracks or albums from the catalogue of 30 million songs available to stream.</h3>
    <p>Some users have reported that typing into the search field in apple music on ios returns no results at all. Instead of opening the corresponding artist, song or album pages apparently there is though some manual work is involved in the process. Basically, you must manually change the url for each itunes store link that redirects to apple. Wonder how to fix apple music not working, apple music down, or various apple music problems on ios 13/12/11?</p>
