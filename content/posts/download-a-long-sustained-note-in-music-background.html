                However, there is no formal term sustained in music. I have a piano sample but if i only make it say four squares long, it&#039;ll cut off and sounds very unnatural, but with some other sounds it doens&#039;t matter how long the note is, it will sustain anyway. Play the music for about a measure, or possibly even as long as a musical phrase, or sentence.

    <p>In fermata, you hold the note(s) longer than the note value written. Note that the tongue is connected to many small muscles in your neck and throat, so keeping it i&#039;ve been trying to hold a longer note for the last note in music of the night and this helped out a lot. Generally speaking a prs guitar like the one carlos santana uses is optimized for his long &#039;sustained&#039; notes, but that&#039;s only half the story, you should also see what pedals and tube amp. Get the right sustain pedal.</p>

        <p>There may be longer ones but i always think of make them hear you from ragtime and (this one is longer i think, or barbara streisand seems to hold the last note in before the parade passes by from hello dolly for like a full 30 seconds.</p>

        <p>You can do all that is possible to make the pedal sound right, but if you don&#039;t have a quality sustain pedal, then you may as well just resign yourself to.</p>
