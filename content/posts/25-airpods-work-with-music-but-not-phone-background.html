                I did not have this problem with my original airpods, which i also used with 10.12.6 without problems (at least that i am cognizant of). Fortunately there&#039;s a quick fix for most problems, and a few other tricks you can try if your issues persist. The battery indicator for the airpods won&#039;t display on your phone, and siri won&#039;t be available to answer any of your requests.

    <h3>If you use an iphone/ipad or mac, both devices will automatically get reconnected.</h3>
    <p>Airpods , which should work with any android phone provided it has bluetooth. Earpods (lightning connector) , which will not work with any device that doesn&#039;t have a lightning port, android phones included. Quite the contrary, a large portion of smartphone users, specifically those using android, are served airpods only use aac, and that&#039;s a problem for android. My airpods worked fine on the iphone 8 for about a day and a half before they started having an but when i tried to play music they would start playing music from the phone.</p>
