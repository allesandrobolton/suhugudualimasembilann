                This is a bug and others would probably have faced the error as well enter your apple id password if prompted (this is where apple music and itunes come to understand whether you&#039;re signed in or not) and then try. Apple music → tap on ≡ → tap on your name → sign out. Find the apple music service.
    </p>

    <h3>Apple music → tap on ≡ → tap on your name → sign out.</h3>
    <p>Scroll down the account settings page and click the manage. Each time this has happened, i&#039;ve confirmed that i&#039;m signed into itunes and eventually have to restart the i had the same problem, it told me i wasn&#039;t signed in to apple music when trying to play a song. To avoid this, cancel and sign in to youtube on your computer. You must be signed in to apple music in order to play apple music songs. the fun thing is, i can actually listen to all the apple music songs when i use the search abr on the right top side.</p>
