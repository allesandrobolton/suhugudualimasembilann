                I followed the steps outlined in the video and online from youtube tv. I bought apple music for my 15 yo and once i realized it was cheaper to get family share instead of individual i switched it. Family and guests can play one another&#039;s games while earning their own steam achievements and saving their own game progress to the steam cloud.
    </p>

    <h3>How do i fix steam family sharing not working?</h3>
    <p>This covers the content someone. Jul 2, 2015 on your family member&#039;s device, make sure their account is signed in for both icloud and itunes in settings. Our family is considering moving from spotify to youtube premium. Has anyone been able to get this to work properly?</p>
