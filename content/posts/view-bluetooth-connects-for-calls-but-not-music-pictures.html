                I&#039;ve tried using the device manager to stop and start the various items (enumerators and dell wireless 1703 bluetooth) all to no avail. This is a quick fix tutorial on if you run into the issue of your bluetooth connecting for phone calls but not audio for music. .my bluetooth connection was fine it connected to my car and headset but now it only receives calls but does not play music through my bluetooth headphones.
    </p>

    <h3>After confirming the bluetooth connection between the devices, test the bluetooth if you are still unable to hear any sound after completing the above steps, there may be an issue with the speaker connections or wiring.</h3>
    <p>Bluetooth connects to my car or headphones but after the update to android 10, while podcasts and all other audio worked perfectly, music would not play through bluetooth. I&#039;ve got a bluetooth headset which works great in both windows 8 and android 4.2 however on ubuntu (13.10) it just doesn&#039;t seem to work. .my bluetooth connection was fine it connected to my car and headset but now it only receives calls but does not play music through my bluetooth headphones. After picking up the phone i can change it to receive output to my phone&#039;s earpiece but this is annoying to do everytime i receive a call.</p>
