                I&#039;m old school, so i keep all my music on my computer and then manually add songs from itunes (most recent software updated) to my iphone this is a short 4 track album, but none of the 4 songs&#039; track titles are displaying on my phone. If you find some songs on your apple music app are greyed out, and can&#039;t be played on your iphone, ipad or ipod, except looking for solutions to fix it in most cases, apple music not playing on your device results from a sync issue. It&#039;s literally only for st.

    <p>The process is quite simple as shown below. Cover art for songs and albums is automatically added for music files. And also set nowplayinginfo before playing music (have tried set this after playing music also). Tracks streamed through apple music.</p>
