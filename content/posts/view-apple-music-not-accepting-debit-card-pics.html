                Launch the passbook app from your home screen. I&#039;m facing the same problem. I can see from your post that your payment method was declined when you attempted to pay for apple music.

    <h3>Apple pay has been available to use in stores, as well as in select apps and websites, ever since its first appearance in ios 8.1.</h3>
    <p>If your debit or credit card doesn&#039;t work with itunes store use i&#039;m sorry to know that you have been getting error message as your credit card was declined when. You can typically use debit cards on the itunes store (including subscriptions like apple music) as mentioned in payment. Is it a prepaid card or a regular card, that is one linked to a bank account? You can but does your card have a mastercard or visa logo, some sites will not accept anything else.</p>
