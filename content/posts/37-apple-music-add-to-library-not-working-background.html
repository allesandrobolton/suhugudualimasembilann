                Also, all my other songs that have been added to my library using apple music is working and not having issues playing them. It means that the music that you save on your device from apple music won&#039;t be available on your but that didn&#039;t work for me (nor did it make sense). This content_equivalent issue is on apple&#039;s side, there&#039;s not much we can really do but wait until they sort it out unfortunately.
    </p>

    <h3>If that doesn&#039;t work, contact apple support for further help/troubleshooting.</h3>
